<p>As this specimen of the language spoken in Ireland about 1200 years
ago, is here published, not only for the elucidation of our apostle's history,
but also for the gratification of the lovers of Irish literature in general;
the Irish original is accompanied, on the opposite page, with an English
translation of the whole. </p>
<p>In this translation, the literal meaning, and idiomatic expression of
the words and phrases, are adhered to in all such stanzas as the editor (with
the aid of some members of the Gaelic Society, particularly conversant with
subjects of this sort) could fully understand: for he acknowledges that
neither he nor these gentlemen are so vain or disingenuous as to pretend that
they comprehend the whole of this very ancient composition. </p>
<p>In order to obviate any objection which may be made against the
passages in which the editor differs from the author of the version of this
hymn, in Colgan's collection of our patron saint's lives, the Latin
translation adopted in <i>his</i> edition, is also subjoined to the poem, at
the bottom of each page. </p>
<p>To the hymn are added some short notes, illustrative of the subject.
</p>
<p align="center"><i>Vindication of St. Fiech's Hymn, in Answer to Dr.
Ledwich's Objections.</i></p>
<p>Respecting the authenticity and antiquity of this curious specimen of
our language about the commencement of the sixth century, some doubts were
entertained by the sagacious Bollandists, who, consequently, considered St.
Fiech to have lived long after our saint's time. This opinion, those learned
Jesuits founded on Fiech's referring to other <i>histories</i> for the truth
of what he relates with regard to his master, St. Patrick, during the first
sixty years of his life previously to his arrival on the mission of Ireland.
</p>
<p>This plausible objection has been adopted and urged by Dr. Ledwich,
against St. Patrick's existence, with that dogmatical tone of magisterial
positiveness so conspicuous in his volume of invectives against the ancient
splendour, sanctity, and literature of his native country, declaring that
Fiech and Sedulius's poems on our saint "are the wretched productions of some
cloistered ecclesiastic." </p>
<p>To this, the only remaining one of these formidable objections,
adduced by the doctor against our apostle's existence, we answer, that Fiech
lived and composed this hymn some time after St. Patrick's death, in the 120th
year of his age, and 60th of his apostleship. Now supposing Fiech to have
lived to the 84th year of his age, and to have composed this hymn in 600,
seven years after his master's death, which he so circumstantially relates in
the poem; Fiech must consequently have been no more than about 17 years of age
when our saint commenced his mission here. Where, or whence, then, except by
divine revelation, or from St. Patrick himself, or from the revelation of
others, could his disciple derive his information with respect to St.
Patrick's parents and ancestors, who lived in a foreign country? or sacred
Tours, in Gaul, the place of our saint s nativity? or his original name
Succoth? or his voyages and travels by sea and land, after his escape from
servitude in Ireland? or his insular retreats or studies under the spiritual
guidance of St. German of Auxerre? &amp;c, &amp;c. &amp;c. </p>
<p>Now, Fiech very justly informs his readers, that all these
transactions, wrought before he was born, and in a foreign country, during the
first 60 years of his great master's life, were ascertained in <i>skelaiv</i>,
(STORIES,) as in the first stanza; or Fiadhaid, <i>testified to us</i>, as he
says in the sixth stanza of his poem, the only two places were Fiech appeals
to others for the foreign actions performed in the early period of St.
Patrick's life: of whom, though there were many lives written and published
during his existence, yet it is uncertain whether Fiech obtained his account
from written or oral documents, for either may be denoted by the Irish word
<i>Scealaw</i> (stories.) The term by which the translator of this hymn into
Latin has rendered it, may also denote either oral or written information. In
English, too, the word <i>history</i> often imports oral narration: thus Pope
says:</p>
<p class="indent">"What <i>histories</i> of toil could I declare,<br>
But still, long-wearied nature wants repair."</p>

<h1>HYMN ON ST. PATRICK.</h1>
<p align="center">
I.
</p><p class="indent">
  Patrick was born at heavenly Tours, <br>
  As it is ascertained in stories; <br>
  A youth of sixteen years <br>
  At the time he was brought under bondage.
</p><p align="center">
II.
</p><p class="indent">
  Succat his name at the beginning;<br>
  Who his father <i>was</i>, be it known<br>
  Son of Calphurn, son of Otidé,<br>
  <i>Descended</i> from the Deacon Odissé.
</p><p align="center">
III.
</p><p class="indent">
  He was six years in servitude, <br>
  The food of the people he eat not, <br>
  They were all by him supported, <br>
  Four tribes to whom he was enslaved.
</p><p align="center">
IV.
</p><p class="indent">
  Victor (the angel) said to the servant <br>
  Of Milcho: depart over the waves, <br>
  He (Victor) placed his foot upon a stone <br>
  His marks after him remained.
</p><p align="center">
V.
</p><p class="indent">
  He departed over all the mountains,
<br>

  O'er sea, prosperous was his flight. <br>
  He dwelled along with German, <br>
  Southward of the southermost <i>part</i> of Letavia.
</p><p align="center">
VI.
</p><p class="indent">
  In the islands of the Touronian sea<br>
  He resided, as related;<br>
  He read his Canons with German,<br>
  As is certified to us.
</p><p align="center">
VII.
</p><p class="indent">
  Towards Ireland he proceeds,<br>
  Warned by God's angels in apparitions,<br>
  Often saw he in his sleep<br>
  That he ought to return.
</p><p align="center">
VIII.
</p><p class="indent">
  Great the assistance to Eire,<br>
  The coming of Patrick to Oclat:<br>
  He heard the long sound of entreaties<br>
  Of children from the wood of Foclat.
</p><p align="center">
IX.
</p><p class="indent">
  They implored the saint may come<br>
  Upon forsaking Letavia,<br>
  For drawing from error's propensity<br>
  The people of Eire to life.
</p><p align="center">
X.
</p><p class="indent">
  The people of Eire prophesy <br>

  O Druid! upon Laoree, <br>
  <i>The</i> coming of Patrick you hid not;<br>
  Too true the prophecies <br>
  Respecting the sovereign you predicted.
</p><p align="center">
XII.
</p><p class="indent">
  Prudent was Patrick during life;<br>
  Pleasing was in banishing evil propensities;<br>
  This is what extended his fame<br>
  Up to each tribe of people.
</p><p align="center">
XIII.
</p><p class="indent">
  <i>He</i> hymns, and revelations,<br>
  <i>And</i> the three fifties daily sung:<br>
  <i>He</i> preached, baptized, and prayed,<br>
  From praising God he never ceased.
</p><p align="center">
XIV.
</p><p class="indent">
  He felt not the cold of the season;<br>
  He stayed the night in the waters,<br>
  With heaven to be blessed as his kingdom,<br>
  He preached through the day on the hills.
</p><p align="center">
XV.
</p><p class="indent">
  In saving the people of Benibarka<br>
  He experienced neither drought nor hunger;<br>
  He sang an hundred psalms each night,
<br>

  The King of angels to serve.
</p><p align="center">
XVI.
</p><p class="indent">
  He then rested on a bare stone,<br>
  And a wet coverlid over him,<br>
  A rock was his pillow,<br>
  He left not his body in indolence.
</p><p align="center">
XVII.
</p><p class="indent">
  He preached the Gospel to all;<br>
  He worked great miracles at Letavia<br>
  He healed the blind with fasting,<br>
  The dead he awoke to life.

XVIII.
</p><p class="indent">
  Patrick preached to the Scotians <br>
  <i>After</i> he underwent great labours in Letavia, <br>

  Patrick being about to sicken, <br>

  An angel came upon his head <br>
  On the way, in the middle of the day.

XXIV.
</p><p class="indent">
  He proceeded southerly to Victor (angel)<br>
  It was he who sent for him,<br>

XXV.

<p>St. Fiech, the author of the above Hymn, was a disciple to Duvhach,
poet laureate of Laoree, monarch of Ireland. He was converted by St. Patrick,
who taught him the elements of the Latin language, in which he was enabled to
read the bible after fifteen days' study. Fiech was appointed bishop of
Leinster by his holy master, upon which he founded a celebrated monastery,
called from him <i>Domnach-Fiech</i>, on the mountain of Sletty, about a mile
to the north of Carlow, in the territory of Leix, now in the barony of Slieve-
Margey, and Queen's county. In this church, the remains of which still exist,
he also established a college, celebrated for producing many saints, as may be
seen in Colgan's Lives of Irish Saints, &amp;c. </p>
<br><br><br>
<h1>NOTES.</h1>
<p align="center"><img src="images/hand.jpg" alt="A hand"><i>The figures
refer to the stanzas</i>. </p>
<p><a name="1">(1)</a> In the Latin translation accompanying Colgan's
edition of this Hymn Nein Thur, or <i>Holy Tours</i>, is rendered into
<i>Nemthur</i>, as if the two words were but one, designating a place of that
name. In the fifth and ninth stanzas, the word <i>Lethu</i> or <i>Letha</i>,
is rendered by <i>Latium</i> or <i>Italy</i>: upon which absurd translation,
Colgan, without rectifying the mistake, observes that <i>Nisi Germanus dicatur
degisse in eis (insulis Tyrrheni maris) videtur hic preposterus ordo</i>;
"except St. German be said here to have lived in them, (the islands of the
Tyrrhenian sea,) the order of time seems preposterous." So contradictory does
this appear to the Latin translator, that he has totally mistranslated the
17th and 18th verses, in which <i>Letha</i> again occurs, by his omitting the
word altogether. The editor's reason for deviating from the Latin translation
may be seen, at full length, in the preceding work. </p>
<p><a name="2">(2)</a> Colgan, from the psalter of Cashel, traces back
St. Patrick's pedigree to the 17th progenitor, thus: </p>

<table class="indent">
<tr><td><p>  Calphurnius     </p><td><p>1 </p>
<tr><td><p>  Potitus  </p><td><p>2 </p>
<tr><td><p>  Mercutius</p><td><p>3 </p>
<tr><td><p>  Oda, or Othus   </p><td><p>4 </p>

<tr><td><p>  Nemethus</p><td><p>17</p>
<tr><td><p>  &amp;c. &amp;c.</p><td><p>&nbsp;</p>
</table>
<p>From the names of the above list, if they could be depended on, it
would appear that St. Patrick's ancestors were of Roman origin. </p>
<p><a name="3">(3)</a> As Father Michael Clery, one of the annalists
called the four masters was employed for fifteen years previously to the
Anglo-Cromwellian invasion in collecting Irish manuscripts, and translating
them into Latin for Colgan's Lives of the Irish Saints, it is very probable he
was the translator of this Hymn into Latin at the same time. He was also the
author of an Irish dictionary of difficult words. To the translation of such a
scholar, made also at a time when the language was regularly studied in the
seminaries of Ireland, great deference must be paid. In this third stanza,
however, the editor has ventured to deviate from his version, which runs thus,
according to the Latin words "St. Patrick was six years in slavery, during
which he eat not the food of the (heathenish) people. For this reason he was
called Cathraige, because he served four masters." Now, as <i>Cothraighe</i>
may also mean a supporter, maintainer, protector, &amp;c. this last import of
the word is adopted in the English translation. </p>
<p><a name="4">(4)</a> Instead of St. Patrick's running over the Italian
"Alps," as the Latin translator affirms here, he travelled over all the
mountains from the north to the south of Ireland, whence he took shipping for
his native country; for <i>Ealpa uile</i> denotes all mountains in general.
</p>
<p><a name="5">(5)</a> Tassach was originally a brazier and silversmith,
who ornamented the celebrated crozier of St. Patrick, called the <i>Staff of
Jesus</i>. Tassach was afterwards a priest. </p>
<p>In the 5th, 6th, 9th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 18th stanzas, the English
translation will be found to differ very materially from the Latin one. Some
verses of the 28th and 31st stanzas, neither the editor nor some literary
friends (of whose observations he has availed himself in translating other
parts of the Hymn) could make any tolerable sense; he at the same time
acknowledges, that he is far from being satisfied with the Latin translation.
He thinks it necessary to observe here, once for all, that the Hymn has been
faithfully collated with, and printed word for word, according to Father
Colgan's edition. </p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
